# Concentration of Volume
A collection of code and visualisations related to the MATH40008 Poster Project on Concentration of Volume. 

<details>
<summary>"What is MATH40008"</summary>
MATH40008 is a module all first year maths undergraduates at Imperial College London take after completing their summer exams. They are expected to construct a poster and give a presentation on a topic related to one of the five main topics provided by the department via independent research. Concentration of Volume falls under 'Law of Large Numbers and The Central Limit Theorem'.

One of the main theorems we showcase in the poster is that in high dimensions almost all the volume of the n-Cube concentrates on an (n-1)- Sphere. The main idea is that in high dimensional cubes we can think of each point as having coordinates which are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables. In order for a point to lie at an extremity these random variables must all cooperate. This is unlikely and the Law of Large Number stipulates that for large n this is impossible. Instead points will exist close to the average. Geometrically we must exist a certain distance from the origin. This is essentially what a sphere in high dimensions is. For more details see the poster and other files in this repository.
